# About Me

I have been working in the IT sector since 2012, particularly in the health care area. Currently I work as  software architect and team leader.

In 2017 I graduated as a Computer Engineer from the Faculty of Engineering (UdelaR). The same year I began teaching at UTEC and since 2020 I have the responsibility of being the career coordinator of the Technologist Informatic at the San Jos√© headquarters.

In 2021 I joined the [SoftTero](https://softtero.com) project whose goal is to be a company that provides IT services such as custom software solutions, outsourcing and consulting.
